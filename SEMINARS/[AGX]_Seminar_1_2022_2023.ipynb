For those who do not know it, it is a fictional series from the HBO chain, inspired by the series of novels \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", which tells the experiences of a group of characters from different noble houses on the fictional continent of *Westeros* to have control of the Iron Throne and rule the seven kingdoms that make up the territory. The series' success has spawned many blogs and other sources about the series, with additional resources. The graphs that we propose to use in this exercise represent the characters of the series (or books) as nodes, and their co-appearance in a scene (the weights of the edges are higher if two characters appear simultaneously more times). So we have a social network of characters. We will use these graphs to work on some of the concepts seen in the first units of the course (graph and node metrics, search and routes). Finally, synthetic graphs that simulate a realistic network will be generated."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wLiz4rCDKvnz"},"source":["## Qualification\n","\n","**Submission**: An '.ipynb' file from the colab corresponding to each group will be delivered (this very same file, adding the code blocks and explanations that correspond to each activity).
